These data files are instances randomly  generated  following  the guidelines  of:
V. Gabrel,  M. Lacroix,  C. Murat,  N. Remli,  Robust location transportation problems under uncertain demands, Discrete Applied Mathematics 164 (2014) 100-111.
Nevertheless, the fixed costs and capacities are multiplied for 10 and 6, respectively, in the source code to make the instances harder. 

The value of each parameter is given in the files n-m-type-gamma.txt and follows the sequence:
 n                      // // number of facilities
 m                      // // number of customers
 Gamma                  // // budget of uncertainty
 d[j]   d_[j]           // // d demand nominal,  d_ desviation 
 f[i]   a[i]    k[i]    // // fixed costs, capacity costs, capacity of the facility
 c[i][j]                // // transportation costs;
